Snake game
	- need to reduce the game to discrete steps (frames)
		- rather than a continuous flow
	- it has three actors
		- the head of the snake
			- controls movement, initiates contact with ball
			- determines where body spawns
		- the sprite
			- spawn at a new spot as its eaten
				- can't spawn on a current body tile
			- dissappears upon contact with snake
			- increments score
		- the body of the snake  
			- grows with each pellet consumption
			- the tail is deleted per frame
			- collission with the head causes failure
	- game screen can be divided into a grid, with three states
		- empty
		- snake
		- pellet
	
	
Grid Manager
	- maintains state of each cell of the game grid 
	- on each step of the game, determine where the head is currently
		- if on a pellet
			- delete pellet 
			- create a "body" where the tail of the snake was in the previous frame
		- if on a body 
			- set to game failure 
		- delete the "tail" of the snake
			- 
	- Grid is made of Cell objects
		- cell positions are maintained by each actor
		- Grid contains state of each cell for rendering
	
		
			
Game Screen
	- main game logic
	- transfers to other screens
	
Pause screen (also pause screen?)
	- key to close
	- if pause is clicked, game is paused with pause overlay
	
Game over screen
	- if head hits body 
	- or rare case that a new pellet can't spawn
